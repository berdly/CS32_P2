# DogFight
A Space Shooter Game
by Jakob Pinedo and Sawyer Rice

To play, simply use the command "make game" and the Makefile will generate the necessary files.
Then the executable can be played with a simple "./game" or other command to run the executable depending on your system.

Movement is done with the WASD keys (A and D to rotate the ship, W and S to accelerate and brake the ship),
and the J key is used to fire at enemies.

Survive as long as you can against an onslaught of invaders!
